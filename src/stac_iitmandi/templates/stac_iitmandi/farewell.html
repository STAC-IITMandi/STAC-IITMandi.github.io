              thanks a lot for leading an important path for the growth of our club. Your desire to develop the college

              behind almost every college fest, you are an inspiration for many in the institute. Thanks for guiding
              STAC for making important decisions; which always turned out fruitful. We grew a lot under your
              mentorship, and continue to do so in future by following your vision.

              people like you. We cherish the good intellectual conversations we had with you; when you organised the
              first Enigma and set an example for the same. You knew a lot but was always curious to know more; which
              inspired many. You helped the club for many critical and difficult activities; for which we are indebted
